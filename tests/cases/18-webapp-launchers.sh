# Web app launchers: which of them are this machine's state, and which of them
# can come back.
#
# A launcher is an Exec line, and Omarchy writes that line three ways: a bare
# URL, a bare URL followed by browser flags, and a quoted URL, which is what
# `omarchy webapp install` writes today. The restore used to read everything
# after the launcher name as the URL, which refused the second and third forms —
# so a launcher made by the current installer, or one carrying a Chromium
# profile flag, was captured and then dropped on the machine that needed it.
