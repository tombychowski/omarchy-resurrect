# A plugin or a theme whose git remote a restore will not take is a gap the vault
# cannot close by itself: the far side has no way to fetch the code, and the
# machine that holds the checkout is the only one that can push it somewhere git
# can reach. Saying so at capture is the difference between a backup that reports
# what it holds and one that reports what it kept.
#
# The case worth naming: a plugin developed in a working directory, with a
# `file://` remote. Nothing warns, the restore then refuses it as an unsafe
# remote, and the first machine to say anything is the one that cannot fix it.
