# The mutation runner decides a mutation was caught when the suite goes red. A
# case that is red before anything has been broken therefore makes every mutation
# look caught, and the run reports a clean sweep over a suite that is not
# passing. That is worse than no run: it is a false claim of coverage, and it is
# how a mutation that changes nothing comes to be believed.
#
# So the runner checks the baseline first, and refuses to report on mutations
# when the suite does not pass on its own.
#
# This case runs the runner, and the runner's clean baseline is the full suite,
# so under the runner it skips itself rather than recursively testing the
# baseline gate while that gate is already being established.

# refuse to run, and must not report anything as caught.

# The copy runs with its own PATH. Leaving this tree's doubles on it as well puts
# two copies of each double in front of the real tool, and the git double
# resolves the real git by scanning PATH for one that is not itself: with two
# copies on the path they point at each other and the case hangs rather than
# failing. (The double also refuses to hand off to another copy now, which is the
# fix for anyone else who nests a suite inside a suite.)
