# Testing strategy

Five layers, in the order they catch things. The suite, mutation runner, and
static/model QML checks are automated. Scratch-directory integration needs a
real Omarchy machine, and the final layer needs a clean Omarchy VM. The six
original restore boundaries and the applied-loadout cleanup boundaries below
remain manual evidence.

## 1. The suite

```bash
./tests/run.sh              # every case
./tests/run.sh aur          # just the ones whose name matches
```

The baseline run for the documentation change on 2026-10-03 passed **21 cases
and 575 assertions**. Treat those numbers as a recorded baseline, not a target
to preserve by weakening or combining assertions; the current runner output is
authoritative after tests change.

Each case runs in a throwaway `$HOME` with test doubles on `PATH` for `pacman`,
`yay`, `sudo`, `systemctl`, `curl`, `git` and the `omarchy` CLI. Nothing outside
the sandbox is read or written: no package is installed, no unit is enabled, and
the fake `sudo` has no privileges — it records the call and runs the rest of the
line as you. That is what lets a case assert a restore *did not* do something,
which is most of what the consent work is about.

The `git` double is the subtle one: it rewrites `https://github.com/example/…`
to a local path, but only for `clone`, `fetch`, `pull`, `push` and `ls-remote`.
Rewriting globally would make capture record a `/tmp` path and restore then
refuse it as an unsafe remote — an artefact of the test rather than of ress.

## 2. Mutation testing

```bash
./tests/mutate.sh           # multi-hour currently; every mutation runs the whole suite
```

A passing suite says the tests agree with the code, not that they would notice
if the code were wrong. This breaks one behaviour at a time in a throwaway copy
— the AUR gate always builds, the unit gate always enables, the scanner never
finds anything, `verify` always says the machine matches, `plain()` stops
stripping control characters — and reports any mutation no test caught.

Run it when you change what the tests are *for*, not on every edit. A `SURVIVED`
line is a feature the suite only appears to cover. The historical 12-minute
estimate no longer applies: the applied-loadout cases substantially expanded
the suite, and the serial runner still executes every case for every mutation.

It runs the suite once before breaking anything, and refuses to report on
mutations when that baseline does not pass: a case that is already red counts as
a catch for every mutation, so a run on a red suite is a clean sweep over tests
that are not passing. `tests/cases/20-mutation-baseline.sh` covers both halves of
that gate.

## 3. The QML half

`tests/cases/16-qml.sh` covers what the bash suite cannot:

- **`Model.js`** is a `.pragma library` — plain JavaScript with no QML API in it
  — so `tests/model-test.js` runs it under node and asserts on it directly.
- **`qmllint`** with the Omarchy and Quickshell imports resolved. Without the
  import paths it emits forty lines of unresolved-import noise and tells you
  nothing; with them, it is a real check.
- **A cross-file check qmllint cannot do.** The panel reaches the engine through
  a dynamically typed property, so a binding to an engine member that does not
  exist renders blank and reports nothing anywhere. Every `engine.<member>` in
  `Panel.qml` is checked against `Service.qml`.

None of this proves the panel *draws*. See §4.

## 4. On a real machine, without a VM

These use the real tools against scratch directories, and are worth running
before a release. None of them touches the live desktop or the real vault.

```bash
# A real capture of this machine into a scratch vault, then the round-trip
# invariant: a vault captured from a machine must verify against that machine.
ress backup  --vault /tmp/rt-vault -m "round trip"
ress verify  --vault /tmp/rt-vault      # expect: matches, exit 0
ress scan    --vault /tmp/rt-vault

# A real restore into a scratch home. Three commands must not reach the running
# session, so shadow them: a shell restart, the IPC client that edits the live
# bar layout, and the live theme switcher.
mkdir -p /tmp/rt-bin
printf '#!/bin/sh\nexit 0\n' > /tmp/rt-bin/omarchy-restart-shell
printf '#!/bin/sh\nexit 1\n' > /tmp/rt-bin/omarchy-shell
printf '#!/bin/sh\nexit 0\n' > /tmp/rt-bin/omarchy-theme-set
chmod +x /tmp/rt-bin/*

env -i HOME=/tmp/rt-home PATH="/tmp/rt-bin:$PATH" TERM=dumb USER="$USER" \
  ress restore --from /tmp/rt-vault --yes --no-enable-units --skip packages
```

`--skip packages` because installing them for real needs root, and
`--no-enable-units` because `systemctl --user` talks to the session manager
rather than to `$HOME` — enabling a unit for a scratch home would enable it in
your real session.

Then check the upgrade path on a copy of a vault written by the previous
version, and the update mechanism on a copy of the installed plugin:

```bash
cp -a ~/.local/share/ress/vault /tmp/upgrade-vault
git -C /tmp/upgrade-vault remote remove origin      # so nothing can be pushed
ress backup --vault /tmp/upgrade-vault              # expect the manifest rename

cp -a ~/.config/omarchy/plugins/tsouth89.resurrect /tmp/plugin-update
git -C /tmp/plugin-update fetch origin HEAD
git -C /tmp/plugin-update merge --ff-only FETCH_HEAD
omarchy-plugin-validate /tmp/plugin-update
```

The AUR annotation is the one integration the doubles cannot stand in for,
because it is a live HTTP API and the encoding is fiddly (`arg%5B%5D=`, `curl
-g`, and `+` encoded as `%2B` or the AUR reads it as a space). Give a scratch
vault a `packages/foreign.txt` with one real AUR name and one invented one, and
answer `n` at the prompt: the invented one should be marked *not on
aur.archlinux.org*.

Applied-loadout command-boundary cases use the same scratch machine model to
prove registry validation/atomicity, claims, conflict planning, drift, repair,
direct package arguments, preservation decisions, Omarchy delegation, theme
precedence, and panel parsing. Before release, additionally exercise a scratch
registry with real tools: confirm mode `0600`, make a package-removal target
that pacman refuses for dependencies, remove a disposable plugin/web app/theme
through Omarchy, and verify an active-theme fallback. Do not use the live vault
or a valued package/integration for these checks.

The reproducible form is:

```bash
tests/manual/loadout-real-scratch.sh
```

It redirects all mutable user state to a `mktemp` home, uses pacman's read-only
removal planner for the dependency refusal, exercises real disposable Omarchy
cleanup targets, and runs real theme selection in Omarchy's headless mode. The
2026-10-04 run passed on Omarchy `4.0.0.alpha` with pacman `7.1.0`; its full
observations and limitations are recorded in the active change's
`evidence.md`. It does not authorize or perform a successful root package
removal and does not prove visible rendering.

## 5. What only a VM can tell you

Everything above leaves six things unproven. All of them need a clean Omarchy
install, which [Fresh-machine validation](fresh-machine-validation.md) walks
through.

1. **Installing packages.** `sudo pacman -S` and `yay` building real PKGBUILDs
   have never run under test — the doubles record the call and stop. This is the
   single biggest gap, and it is the category most likely to be slow or to fail
   halfway.
2. **A machine that genuinely lacks things.** A scratch `$HOME` on your own
   machine still has every package installed system-wide, so "restore installs
   what is missing" is only ever exercised against a machine where nothing is.
3. **The panel drawing.** `qmllint` proves the QML parses and resolves; it does
   not prove the bar widget appears, that the two consent rows render, or that
   clicking one writes the setting.
4. **Units actually starting.** Enabling is tested; a unit coming up with the
   session at next login is not.
5. **The theme actually applying.** `omarchy-theme-set` is shadowed in every
   test above, so the desktop visibly changing is unverified.
6. **The timing claim.** The README's restore number can only come from a real
   run on a fresh install.
7. **Real package removal transactions.** The double proves exact safe flags,
   dependency refusal, and resume logic; only pacman proves its real dependency
   diagnosis and post-removal database state.
8. **Real Omarchy cleanup side effects.** Plugin unload/rescan, launcher/icon
   cleanup, and theme removal are delegated to Omarchy and must be observed.
9. **Theme effect rendering.** Tests prove precedence commands; a VM proves the
   fallback is visibly usable and an external selection remains undisturbed.
10. **The Loadouts panel drawing.** Model tests and qmllint do not prove row
    density, focus order, selection detail, or terminal handoff on the desktop.

The 2026-10-04 Proxmox run recorded the exact status of these boundaries in
[Fresh-machine validation](fresh-machine-validation.md). It closed the native
package install and direct-removal, genuine-absence, Loadouts panel, and real
Omarchy cleanup gaps for the disposable fixtures. It also observed real theme
state precedence, fallback, baseline restoration, external override
preservation, and the two fallback transitions on a rendered desktop. It did
**not** exercise an AUR build, unit startup, encrypted secrets, or a timed
full-vault restore; those remain manual release evidence.
